## What is SFTP

SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol) is a secure file transfer protocol that uses SSH (Secure Shell) for authentication and encryption. It is a popular way to transfer files between two computers over a network, and it is often used for backing up files, transferring files between servers, and deploying software.
