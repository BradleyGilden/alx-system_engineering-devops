# OSI model (Open Systems Interconnection model)

* Conceptual framework for how application communicate over a network

* There are 7 layers, and the layers depiction help users identify what happens in a networking system:
    1. [Application](#the-application-layer)
    2. Presentation
    3. Session
    4. Transport
    5. Network
    6. Data Link
    7. Physical

* These layers are provided by a mixture of network car drivers, operating systems, applications and networking hardware that facilitate the transmission over wifi, fibre optic or any other wireless [protocols](#00-network-protocol)

<br>

### The Application Layer

* The application layer provides network services to the end user. these services are protocols that work with the data the client is using.

* One of these protocols may be [HTTP]() that work with various browsers, Chrome, Firefox, Brave etc

### 00# network protocol:

A network protocol is a set of rules for formatting data so that all connected devices can process it. Read about the different network layer protocols.

### 01# HTTP

The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application layer protocol in the Internet protocol suite model for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems.[1] HTTP is the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web, where hypertext documents include hyperlinks to other resources that the user can easily access, for example by a mouse click or by tapping the screen in a web browser.
