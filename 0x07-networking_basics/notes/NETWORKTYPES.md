# Types Of Area Networks

Most common types are:

* LAN (Local Area Network) [ethernet, usb]
* WLAN (Wireless Local Area Netword) [bluetooth]
* WLAN (Wide Area Network) [the internet]

## LAN: Local Area Network

A LAN connects network devices over a relatively short distance. A networked office building, school, or home usually contains a single LAN, though sometimes one building contains a few small LANs (perhaps one per room), and occasionally a LAN spans a group of nearby buildings. In TCP/IP networking, a LAN is often, but not always, implemented as a single IP subnet.

In addition to operating in a limited space, LANs are also typically owned, controlled, and managed by a single person or organization. These networks also tend to use certain connectivity technologies, primarily Ethernet and Token Ring.

## WAN: Wide Area Network

A WAN spans a large physical distance. The internet is the largest WAN, spanning the Earth.

A WAN is a geographically-dispersed collection of LANs. A network device called a router connects LANs to a WAN. In IP networking, the router maintains both a LAN address and a WAN address.

A WAN differs from a LAN in several important ways. Most WANs (like the internet) aren't owned by a single organization. Instead, WANs exist under collective or distributed ownership and management.

WANs tend to use technology like ATM, Frame Relay, and X.25 for connectivity over the longer distances.
